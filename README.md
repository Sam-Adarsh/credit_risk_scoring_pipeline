# 📊 Credit Risk Scoring Pipeline

An **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** for credit risk scoring using the **German Credit Dataset (OpenML id=31)**.  
This project demonstrates how to build, evaluate, and persist a production-ready model for financial risk assessment.  

---

## 🔎 Overview  
- Loads dataset directly from **OpenML**.
- Preprocesses numerical & categorical features (imputation, scaling, one-hot encoding).
- Trains a **Gradient Boosting Classifier** using scikit-learn.
- Evaluates with **accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and classification report**.
- Saves the trained pipeline for reuse with `joblib`.
